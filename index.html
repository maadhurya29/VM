    <h1>Our Beautiful Love Journey ❤️</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>📞 It Started With a Prank</h2>
        <p>
            It started as just a prank call… something silly, something casual.
            I never knew that one small moment would slowly become the most important part of my life.
            What began as a joke… turned into admiration.
            And that admiration slowly turned into love.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>👀 Secretly Admiring You</h2>
        <p>
            I don’t know what exactly happened to me…
            but suddenly, I always wanted to talk to you.
            I waited for chances to see you in college.
            Whenever you walked past me, my heart behaved differently.
            Even a small eye contact used to make my whole day.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>📱 The Instagram Request</h2>
        <p>
            The day I found your Instagram ID and sent you a request…
            that simple follow changed everything in my heart.
            Every notification from you made me smile.
            Even though you treated me like a friend,
            I never had the courage to confess my feelings.
            So I decided to stay as your friend… loving you silently.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🛕 Our First Journey – Yadagirigutta</h2>
        <p>
            Our first journey to Yadagirigutta is something I will never forget.
            That day was not just a trip… it was a feeling.
            The way you took care of everything,
            the way you made sure I was comfortable,
            I felt safe. I felt important.
            I didn’t say it then… but I was already falling for you.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>📅 December 3, 2022</h2>
        <p>
            December 3, 2022…
            The day our friendship turned into a relationship.
            I never expected you had feelings for me too.
            That day changed us forever.
            From that moment… you became mine.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🔥 Our Fights & Our Love</h2>
        <p>
            We fight. We argue.
            Sometimes I behave possessive because you are mine.
            Even if I get angry, it lasts only 5 minutes.
            Because staying angry with you hurts more than the reason.
            No matter how many misunderstandings come,
            at the end of the day… we always choose each other.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🌸 My Heart</h2>
        <p>
            You don’t know how many times I think about you in a day.
            Randomly smiling because of you.
            Missing you even when we just met.
            If life gives me a chance,
            I want to spend more and more time with you.
            More trips, more laughs, more memories… more “us”.
        </p>
    </div>

        <h2>💍 Forever With You</h2>
        <p>
            From a prank call… to my forever person.
            From strangers… to soulmates.
            I love you more than you think.
            More than my anger.
            More than my ego.
            More than anything.
